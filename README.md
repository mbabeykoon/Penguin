# Penguin Classification
This app predicts the Palmer Penguin species! Data obtained from the palmerpenguins library in R by Allison Horst.
We'll follow these two major steps in our program in this project: 1) Use RandomForestClassifier in model_pengu.py to build the machine learning model, 
and it is saved as a pickle file. 2)predict the penguin species using a saved model by taking user input collected using streamlit web app.
Here is the screenshot of the app created using streamlit.
